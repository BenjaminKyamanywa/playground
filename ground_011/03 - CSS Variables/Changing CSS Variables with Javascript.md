# üóÇÔ∏è Changing CSS Variables with Javascript

We are going to explore how we can change how things look on a webpage using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Imagine we have sliders and color pickers that can adjust colors, sizes, and blurriness!

### A glimpse into our markup

___

Here we set up our structure for the inputs and labels for the variables we'll be changing.

```HTML

<h2>Update <span class="highlight">CSS</span> Variables with <span class="highlight">JS</span></h2>
    <div class="controls">
      <label for="spacing">Spacing:</label>
      <input type="range" name="spacing" min="10" max="200" value="10" data-sizing="px" id="spacing">

      <label for="blur">Blur:</label>
      <input type="range" name="blur" min="0" max="25" value="10" data-sizing="px" id="blur">

      <label for="base">Base color:</label>
      <input type="color" name="base" value="#fb00ff">
</div>

```

- We have sliders and color pickers that control what our webpage looks like.
- We use the sliders (`spacing` and `blur`) to adjust sizes and blurriness, and a color picker (`base`) to change colors.


### CSS Highlights

___

We'll go over our variable styles and base styling for our page.


```CSS


:root {
  --base: #fb00ff;
  --spacing: 10px;
  --blur: 10px;
}


```

- The variables (`--base`, `--spacing`, `--blur`) store colors, sizes, and blurriness settings.
- We'll use these for a user to be able to change their values in the browser.

### Uncovering our JS

___

We'll uncover our Javascript and go over our funtions, event listeners and the variable changes.

```JS

// Initialize variables

const inputs = document.querySelectorAll('.controls input');

// initialize handleUpdate function for elements updates
const handleUpdate = (event) => {
  const target = event.currentTarget;
  // get data set values from elements
  const suffix = target.dataset.sizing || '';
  
  // add styling properites to elements based on user values
  document.documentElement.style.setProperty(`--${target.name}`, target.value + suffix);

}

// addEvent listener for element input changes
inputs.forEach(input => input.addEventListener('input', handleUpdate));

```

- Accessing the Element:
    - In handleUpdate, we use `event.currentTarget` instead of `event.target`.
    - `event.currentTarget` always refers to the element to which the event listener is attached (`input` element in this case).
    - This ensures that even if the event bubbles up through nested elements, `currentTarget` always refers to the correct input element.
- Setting CSS Variables:
    - We continue to use `document.documentElement.style.setProperty` to dynamically set CSS variables based on the input element's `name` attribute and its `value` + `suffix`.
- Event Listener Setup:
    - The `forEach` loop iterates over all `input` elements with class `controls`.
    - Each input element has an event listener attached to the `input` event, which triggers `handleUpdate`.
    - This setup ensures that CSS variables are updated immediately as the user interacts with the input elements.
- Event Handling Change:
    - Instead of using specific events like `change` or `mousemove`, which trigger only when the value changes or mouse moves, we use the `input` event. 
    - The `input` event triggers whenever the value of an input changes, regardless of how it changes (keyboard input, mouse dragging, etc.).

### Lessons
___

1. CSS Variables:
    - These are like containers that hold different values. By adjusting these values, we can change how our webpage looks without rewriting lots of CSS code.

2. Event Listeners:
    - These are like ears that listen for actions, such as moving a slider or clicking a color picker. When they hear something, they tell JavaScript to update the webpage.

3. Our setup:
    - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create a webpage. HTML shows where things go, CSS makes them look good, and JavaScript makes them interactive.

### Conclusion
___

We explored how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript collaborate to create an interactive webpage. We learned about CSS variables, which allow us to adjust colors, sizes, and blurriness easily. 

Remember, with these tools and a little practice, we can create amazing designs on the web!
