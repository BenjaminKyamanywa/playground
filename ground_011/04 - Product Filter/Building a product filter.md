# üè™ Building a products filter

We are going to explore some Javascript array functions by building a products filter application using HTML, CSS and Javascript. We'll utilize the `map`, `filter`, `reduce` ES6 functions understanding their roles and implementations.

Imagine we have inventory products in a store and we need to filter through them based on the categories.

### A glimpse into our markup

___

Here we set up our structure for the inputs and labels for the variables we'll be changing.

```HTML

<div class="container">
      <h1>Inventory</h1>
      <div id="categories"></div>
      <h2>Product List</h2>
      <ul id="product-list"></ul>
      <h2>Total Prices</h2>
      <div id="totals"></div>
    </div>

```

- `<div id="categories">`: Displays checkboxes for filtering product categories.
- `<ul id="product-list">`: Lists products based on selected categories.
- `<div id="totals">`: Container for displaying total prices dynamically.
