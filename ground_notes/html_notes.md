## Introduction

- HTML - Hyper Text Mark Up Language: It represents the content structure of a webpage.
- HTML Elements: The building blocks of an HTML document and these are represented by headings, paragraphs, images, links etc. They are represented by opening and closing tags `<element></element>` e.g <p></p>

The basic syntax:

```HTML
<element>This is where we add content</element>
```

- Void elements: These cannot have any content inside them. They only have a start tag. e.g `<img>` & `<meta>` elements. Sometimes we can add a slash at the end or not, either option is acceptable as some codebases utilize the slashes format. e.g `<img/>`.
- Attributes: Provide additional information about an element or specify how it should behave. These are placed inside the opening tag of an HTML element.

```HTML
<element attribute="value"></element>
```
