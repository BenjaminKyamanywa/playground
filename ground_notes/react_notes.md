## React Concepts

1. Don't touch the DOM i'll do it
    - What is the DOM?
      - It's what a browser uses to display a website or an app.
      - React was built to make changes to the DOM. As such it makes very good use of the ReactDOM where we define expected changes and React takes care of the rest.
2. Build websites like Lego blocks
    - This helps us to build re-usable components that can be used across our websites and apps.
    - We focus on smaller pieces that we can add to one another to build out our full fledged websites & apps.
3. Unidirectional(one way) data flow
    - It helps with our data flow to flow in one direction from parent components to children, which helps reduce complexity of our apps and makes debugging easier.
4. React focuses on the UI, the rest is up to you
    - React focuses on the UI (components and the VirtualDOM) and as such it only works with the view gives us the flexibility to easily work with othe libraries.
