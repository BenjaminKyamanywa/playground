## Introduction

JavaScript is a programming language that allows us to implement complex functionalities on web pages and was initially created to ‚Äúmake web pages alive‚Äù. Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the [JavaScript engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine). The programs in Javascript are called scripts cause they can be written right in a web page‚Äôs HTML and run automatically as the page loads.

Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don‚Äôt need special preparation or compilation to run.

#### Why is it called JavaScript?
- When it was created, initially it had another name: ‚ÄúLiveScript‚Äù. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a ‚Äúyounger brother‚Äù of Java would help.
- But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called `ECMAScript`, and now it has no relation to Java at all.


Example: 

```html

<!-- Index -->
<button type="button">Player 1: Ben</button>

```

```css

/* button styling */

button {
  font-family: "helvetica neue";
  text-transform: uppercase;
  border: 2px solid rgb(200 200 0 / 60%);
  background-color: rgb(0 217 217 / 60%);
  color: rgb(100 0 0 / 100%);
  box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgb(0 0 200 / 40%);
  border-radius: 5px;
  padding: 3px 10px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

```

```js

// button javascript functionality
const button = document.querySelector("button");

// update name user adds when button is clicked
button.addEventListener("click", updateName);

function updateName() {
  // request user to add any name
  const name = prompt("Enter a new name");
  button.textContent = `Player 1: ${name}`;
}

```

### What can it do:
- Store useful values inside variables.
- Perform operations on strings.
- Respond to events on a web page and run code.

### Internal Javascript

We can add Javascript internally to our web pages with the help of a `<script></script>` element that's added before our closing `‚â§/body‚â•` tag. The script tag is added at the bottom of our document after our  `HTML` and `CSS` files to allow for the page to load with our markup and styles before we plug in the interactivity. As such that's the organization flow of files on our webpages.

Example: We add a text element with Javascript to the page each time a user clicks the button.

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
    <title>JS example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button>Click Me</button>
    <!-- we'll add the JS code for here in the below -->
    <script>
      // internal javascript goes here
      function createParagraph() {
        // create paragraph element
        const paragraph = document.createElement('p');
        // add content to the paragraph element
        paragraph.textContent = 'You clicked the button';
        // add paragraph element to the bottom of the body
        document.body.appendChild(paragraph);
      }

      // select button element
      const buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button");

      // add paragraph element plus text each time button is clicked
      for (const button of buttons) {
        button.addEventListener('click', createParagraph);
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

```

### Comments
- We can add comments to our code that will be ignored by the browser as they exist to provide instructions to fellow developers (*and us if we come back many months/years later and can't remember what we did*) on how the code we've written works.
- Single Line comment: written after a double forward slash (`//`)

```js
// this is a single line comment

```

- Multi-line comment is written between the strings `/*` and `*/`.

```js
/*

This is a mutli-line
comment

*/

```

## Inline Javascript Handlers and Event handlers

- It's bad practise to pollute our HTML with these as we would need to add functions to all HTML elements where we need behavior to happen. for example with a button click.

```html

<button onclick="createParagraph()"></button>

<script>
  // JS function for a button click
  function createParagraph() {
      // add logic
  }
<script>

```

### Event Handlers

Instead of including JavaScript in our HTML, we ccan use a pure JavaScript construct. The `querySelectorAll()` function allows us to select all the buttons on a page. We can then loop through the buttons, assigning a handler for each using `addEventListener()`. 

Code example for this is shown below:

```js

const buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button");

for (const button of buttons) {
  button.addEventListener("click", createParagraph);
}

```

## Script Loading strategies
- If we are loading external scripts we can add it to the `<head>` of our HTML document with a type attribute `module`, it's syntax `<script type="module"></script>`.
- The advantage of this is that the browser knows to load the external script after the HTML and CSS are loaded hence as such if a user is connected to a slower network our javascript won't take forever nor never load as opposed to if we put it at the bottom before the closing `</body>` tag.
- It's best practise to put external scripts in the `<head>` element with the module `attribute`.

## Thinking like a programmer

One of the hardest things to learn in programming is not the syntax you need to learn, but how to apply it to solve real-world problems. We need to start thinking like a programmer. 

This generally involves: 
- Looking at descriptions of what our program needs to do. 
- Working out what code features are needed to achieve those things, and how to make them work together.

**This requires a mixture of hard work, experience with the programming syntax, and practice ‚Äî plus a bit of creativity. The more we code, the better we'll get good at it.**

Example: Guess the number game

Game brief:
> I want you to create a simple guess the number type game. It should choose a random number between 1 and 100, then challenge the player to guess the number in 10 turns. After each turn, the player should be told if they are right or wrong, and if they are wrong, whether the guess was too low or too high. It should also tell the player what numbers they previously guessed. The game will end once the player guesses correctly, or once they run out of turns. When the game ends, the player should be given an option to start playing again.

Brief breakdown into simple actionable tasks in as much of a programmer mindset as possible:
1. Generate a random number between 1 and 100
2. Record the turn number the player is on. Start it on 1.
3. Provide player with a way to guess what the number is.
4. Once a guess is submitted record it somewhere first so the player can see their previous guesses.
5. Next, check whether it's the correct number.
6. If it's correct:
    - i. Display congratulations message.
    - ii. Prevent the player from being able to enter more guesses (this would disrupt the game).
    - iii. Display control allowing player to restart the game.
7. If it's wrong and the player has turns left:
    - i. Tell the player they are wrong and whether their guess was too high or too low.
    - ii. Allow player to make another guess.
    - iii. Increment turn number by 1.
8. If it's wrong and player has no turns left:
    - i. Tell player it's game over.
    - ii. Stop player from being able to make more guesses (this would disrupt the game).
    - iii. Display control allowing player to restart the game.
9. Once game restarts, make sure the game logic and UI are completely reset and go back to step 1.

## Troubleshooting Javascript

Here we'll cover some tips on how to find and fix errors in Javscript programs.

### Types of errors

Generally, when we do something wrong in code, there are two types of errors we'll face:

- Syntax errors
  - Spelling errors in code that cause our programs not to run at all, or to stop running part way through.
- Logic Errors
  - Syntax is correct but the code isn't what we intend it to be, meaning that the program runs successfully but gives incorrect results.
  - Often harder to fix as there aren't usually error messages to direct us to the source of the issue.

Example syntax error:

```js

/**********
Example One - typo with addEventListener JS built in function
**********/

guessSubmit.addeventlistener('click', checkGuess); // Error: Uncaught TypeError: guessSubmit.addeventListener is not a function. We have a type with '.addevenelistener'

guessSubmit.addEventListener('click', checkGuess) // we fix the typo in '.addEventListener'

/**********
Example Two - typo with parameter for querySelector()
**********/

const lowOrHi = document.querySelector('lowOrHi'); // Error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'textContent')

// const lowOrHi = document.querySelector('.lowOrHi'); - we need to add a fullstop at the start of our parameter .querySelector('.lowOrHi')

lowOrHi.textContent = 'Last guess was too high!';


```
